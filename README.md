# To Do App
This app is made with React and Redux. User can add items (task name and date when task should be completed) to the to do list, delete them one by one or delete them all at once.
To generate starting files I used create-react-app. Styling is done with Bootstrap.

### Installation
```
npm install
```
### Running
```
npm start
```

The dev server runs on port 3000.
